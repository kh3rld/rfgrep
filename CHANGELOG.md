## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Unix Pipeline Integration**:
    - Automatic pipe detection using `is_terminal::is_terminal()`
    - `--quiet` / `-q` flag for explicit output suppression
    - Smart message suppression when output is piped
    - Seamless integration with grep, awk, sed, xargs, cut, sort, and other Unix tools
- **New Output Formats**:
    - CSV output format (`--output-format csv`) with proper character escaping
    - TSV output format (`--output-format tsv`) with tab/newline escaping
- **New Search Modes**:
    - Count-only mode (`--count` / `-c`) - like `grep -c`
    - Files-with-matches mode (`--files-with-matches` / `-l`) - like `grep -l`
- **Performance Profiling Infrastructure**:
    - `scripts/quick_profile.sh` - Fast performance testing with hyperfine
    - `scripts/profile_benchmarks.sh` - Comprehensive profiling with flamegraph support
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    - `docs/SHELL_PIPELINE_EXAMPLES.md` - 50+ pipeline integration examples (600+ lines)
    - `docs/OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTIONS.md` - Performance optimization roadmap (450+ lines)
    - `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete development session record (800+ lines)

### Changed

- Output automatically suppressed when piped to other commands
- Verbose messages respect quiet flag and pipe detection
- Benchmark test data reduced for stability (100→20 small, 20→5 medium, 5→2 large files)
- Benchmark file sizes reduced (100KB→10KB medium, 1MB→100KB large)

### Fixed

- **NDJSON Output Bug**: `--ndjson` flag now correctly outputs newline-delimited JSON instead of
  text
- **List Extension Filter Bug**: `rfgrep list --extensions rs` now correctly filters to only .rs
  files using case-insensitive comparison
- **Benchmark Memory Issues**: Fixed SIGKILL errors by creating single Tokio runtime per benchmark
  function instead of per iteration

### Performance

- Established performance baseline: 5.5ms for small repos, 41.6ms for 1000 files
- Identified optimization opportunities for 40-50% improvement potential
- CSV/TSV output adds minimal overhead (<0.2ms)
- Count mode optimized for fast counting without full result formatting

### Documentation

- Added 50+ Unix pipeline integration examples
- Created performance optimization roadmap with 8 detailed recommendations
- Documented profiling infrastructure and benchmarking strategies
- Complete session summary with all changes and metrics

  - Updated scripts (e.g. `scripts/run_benchmarks.rs`) to avoid reintroducing `anyhow`.
